rust game idea:

- 2d platformer
- pixel art style
- gravity flipping instead of jumping (like gravity guy maybe)
- gravity doesnt only affect player, but objects in the environment as well
- free movement (unlike gravity guy)
- scene scrolling

name ideas:
gravity_wizard

todo!():
- change wizard color when gravity is flipped/(when midair?)
- level data reader
- win exit
- moving objects
- keys/doors
- enemies
- level browser/level toggle
- main menu
